# Data Science Challenge Submission

## Task Overview

For this challenge, I thoroughly analyzed the simulated media mix marketing dataset spanning from 1st January 2014 to 31st December 2017. The dataset contained crucial historical data related to user acquisition, marketing investments, and revenue for a gaming company. My objective was to perform media mix modelling, understand the impact of various marketing channels on user acquisition and revenue, and propose strategies to optimally allocate the marketing budget for maximum profit.

## Part 1: Media Mix Modelling

I successfully developed statistical models to uncover the relationship between marketing investments and key performance metrics such as Impressions, Clicks, Daily_Total_Installs, and Daily_Total_Revenue. Through rigorous analysis, I identified the media channels that had the most significant impact on both user acquisition and revenue generation. Additionally, I calculated Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS) for each media channel to provide insights into the effectiveness of marketing investments.

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

My exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the dataset. I visualized and summarized key metrics such as installs, revenue, and CPIs over time and across different media channels. I identified potential trends and seasonality patterns that could influence marketing strategies.

## Submission Details

- The code and methodology used for analysis can be found in the provided Jupyter Notebook.
- Visualizations, graphs, and tables are included in the Notebook to enhance the understanding of the analysis.
- A document summarizing my findings, strategies, and recommendation. I've also included them here:

**1. Capitalize on Seasonality:**
   - Launch a multi-channel campaign in August to build anticipation for September's high revenue. Highlight special events and promotions.

**2. Yearly High Revenue Month Strategy:**
   - Allocate 30% of the annual budget to September based on historical trends.
   - Distribute the budget using correlation between ROAS and revenue: Google_Ads > Unity > Facebook > IronSource.

**3. Reinforce Successful Campaigns:**
   - Boost budgets for campaigns with highest ROAS during past Septembers.
   - Enhance targeting strategies to maximize returns.

**4. Targeted User Acquisition:**
   - Use Facebook and Unity for user acquisition, focusing on segments with strong revenue correlations.

**5. Data-Driven Decision Making:**
   - Predict September revenue using machine learning and adjust budgets accordingly.

**6. Multi-Channel Strategy:**
   - Emphasize Google_Ads for high ROAS and Facebook for user acquisition.
   - Personalize content for each channel's audience.

**7. Long-Term Engagement:**
   - Offer special content and rewards to boost engagement beyond September.
   - Utilize IronSource to re-engage existing users.
